# Blinkit-Data-Analysis
This Power BI report explores various aspects of Blinkitâ€™s business data, focusing on customer behavior, product sales, and ordering patterns. I created this project to practice data visualization and improve my understanding of how data can be used to support business decisions.

## Project Highlights

- **Sales Overview Dashboard**: Shows total sales, number of orders, and average order value over time.
- **Top Categories & Products**: Visualizes which product categories and individual items are most frequently purchased.
- **Time-Based Trends**: Analyzes order frequency by time of day and day of the week.
- **Customer Behavior**: Looks at returning vs new customers, their order habits, and geographic distribution (if data available).
- **Interactive Filters**: Slicers for filtering data by date range, city/region, and product type.

## Purpose

The main goal was to turn raw data into meaningful visual insights using Power BI. This helped me understand how e-commerce platforms like Blinkit can use data to optimize inventory, plan delivery schedules, and personalize user experience.

## Tools Used

- **Power BI Desktop** for report creation
- **Power Query Editor** for data cleaning and shaping
- **DAX** for calculated columns and custom measures
